          <p>
            My name is Peter Strele and i am currently studying for an IT degree at "IT-Kolleg Imst".
            My main focus at the moment lies on developing stuff with java for the Back-End (JDBC, MySQL, Maven, JPA, Spring) and
            HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript (Frameworks: Sass, Angular) for the Front-End (Server-side: PHP, Framework: Laravel). 
            I`m constantly trying to improve my allround-skillset, by completing challenges for school, or building websites in my sparetime, 
            as well as building little javascript-games to get a good grip on functional programming.
            Thats the programming side of me. Other than that, i have been a professional musician and E-Sports gamer for a long
            time. I guess being a "ex-gamer" inspired me to learn to code in the first place :) Most important of all, i love coffee.

          <h3>My carreer as musician</h3>
          <p>
            I used to study classical music, by specializing on the instrument trombone at Mozarteum Salzburg. I got my Bachelor degree in 2016.
            My secret love, though, has always been Jazz.. :)

            I`ve played in Bands like: RET Brassband, Viera Blech, MadeByUs, Freiwild, Dixie Brass Tyrol, 
            Jazzorchester Tirol, No Risk No Funk and many more.

            I used to play "TMNF - Trackmania Nations Forever" professionaly under the nickname of "PeZi" for Clans like Team-Dignitas, n!faculty, Begrip, Plan-B and Team Acer.
            I stopped playing shortly after i reached my ultimate goal, which was getting a medal at the "World Cyber Games", which i managed to do in 2010.
            Also, i have won "ORF-Skichallenge" a total of three times.
